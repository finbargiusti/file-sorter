# File sorter.

This contains a project that allows you to sort through a huge amount of files.

I created it to sort through an immense gallery of images taken from a Google Photos export.

## Game plan:

1. Use svelte to make a simple front-end app.
1. Provide a server that will connect with websockets.
1. Use this project to manage messaging: https://socket.io/
1. Use raw HTML to display images.
